<h3> Part 2 </h3>
<ul>
	<li>Difference: Structured content organizes data into small, reusable fields separate from page design. Semantic HTML is the code that labels those pieces on the page, like headings, lists, and links. </li>

	<li>How they work together: Structured content supplies the clean pieces. Semantic HTML presents them and tells browsers and assistants what each piece means. </li>

	<li>Why it matters: It makes pages easier for people and machines to understand, which improves search and voice results. It also cuts errors and lets you reuse content across screens and channels. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Three websites with similar ideas to my website.</h3>

<h3>Part 4</h3>
<ul> 
	<li> Of the methods Jacobs describes, I think neuroplasticity and the switch it up approach would help me most. I can train my brain now by using kinder self talk and repeating small starter actions until they become automatic. When the troll voice appears, I will switch it up by testing whether its claims are true, asking for one concrete next step, and saying thank you before moving on. This could help me change my life to form healthier habits. </li>

	<li>Hyperbolic discounting is the tendency to pick a smaller reward now and postpone a larger reward for later, even when the larger one would be better. To counter that, I can set enforced deadlines that turn far off goals into closer checkpoints. For my class work, I could set weekly due dates, set specific times to work, and use focus mode on my phone so I don't dodge the work. Breaking the project into enforced milestones makes it more manageble.</li>

	<li> Honestly confused which textbook to buy or read, will ask about it during class.</li>
