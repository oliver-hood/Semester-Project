<h1>Dwayne <strong>"The Rock"</strong> Johnson </h1>
<p> Let’s be honest, if the gods on Mount Olympus had a gym, The Rock would be their personal trainer. Dwayne Johnson is as close as a man can get to godhood without requiring daily sacrifices and a temple in his name (although I’m not against the idea).

Physically, he looks like someone sculpted out of granite by a blindfolded Michelangelo on pre-workout. The man is built like he could carry the weight of the world—and still show up to set on time with a protein shake and a motivational Instagram post.

Charisma? Off the charts. He could charm a GPS into giving him directions before he types in the address. And let’s not forget his work ethic: He wakes up at 4am to lift small cars and wrestle existential dread into submission.

He’s played gods, heroes, wrestlers, and even the Tooth Fairy, and somehow made all of them believable. That’s not acting. That’s divine intervention.

So yeah, if I had to pick a modern-day deity, The Rock isn’t just on the list—he’s flexing at the top of it. Amen, brother.</p>
