<h1>Dwayne <strong>"The Rock"</strong> Johnson </h1>

<h3> Overview </h3>

<p> Let’s be honest, if the gods on Mount Olympus had a gym, The Rock would be their personal trainer. Dwayne Johnson is as close as a man can get to godhood without requiring daily sacrifices and a temple in his name (although I’m not against the idea). <br><br>

Physically, he looks like someone sculpted out of granite by a blindfolded Michelangelo on pre-workout. The man is built like he could carry the weight of the world—and still show up to set on time with a protein shake and a motivational Instagram post. <br><br>

Charisma? Off the charts. He could charm a GPS into giving him directions before he types in the address. And let’s not forget his work ethic: He wakes up at 4am to lift small cars and wrestle existential dread into submission. <br><br>

He’s played gods, heroes, wrestlers, and even the Tooth Fairy, and somehow made all of them believable. That’s not acting. That’s divine intervention. <br><br>

So yeah, if I had to pick a modern-day deity, The Rock isn’t just on the list—he’s flexing at the top of it. Amen, brother.<br><br>

<h3>Answers to questions:</h3>
<ul> 
	<li> Of the methods Jacobs describes, I think neuroplasticity and the switch it up approach would help me most. I can train my brain now by using kinder self talk and repeating small starter actions until they become automatic. When the troll voice appears, I will switch it up by testing whether its claims are true, asking for one concrete next step, and saying thank you before moving on. This could help me change my life to form healthier habits. </li>

	<li>Hyperbolic discounting is the tendency to pick a smaller reward now and postpone a larger reward for later, even when the larger one would be better. To counter that, I can set enforced deadlines that turn far off goals into closer checkpoints with real consequences. For my class work, I could set weekly due dates, set specific times to work, and use focus mode on my phone so I don't dodge the work. Breaking the project into enforced milestones makes it more manageble.</li>

	<li> Honestly confused which textbook to buy or read, will ask about it during class.</li>
